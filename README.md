# sagacious-guacamole
A bookmarklet to make the reading on certain websites, specifically Wattpad, more pleasant

Some of the enhancements include a subtle background texture and lower contrast reading with nicer colors.
Another great plus is that the ability to select text will be unlocked for websites that have it disabled.
These enhancements are intended specifically for reading on wattpad but, will work on many other sites, as well.

To use, copy, and paste the code into http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/bookmarklet.html, hit "crunch", then drag the link yo your bookmarks bar.
